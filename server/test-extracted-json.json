      "content": "# Variables in JavaScript\n\nVariables are containers for storing data values. In JavaScript, you can declare variables using three keywords:\n\n## Variable Declaration Keywords\n\n- **`let`** - Used for variables that can be reassigned. This is the modern way to declare variables that may change.\n- **`const`** - Used for variables that cannot be reassigned. Use this for values that should remain constant.\n- **`var`** - The older way to declare variables (not recommended for modern JavaScript).\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\n// Using let - can be reassigned\nlet age = 25;\nage = 26; // This works!\n\n// Using const - cannot be reassigned\nconst name = \"John\";\n// name = \"Jane\"; // This would cause an error!\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Use `const` by default\n- Use `let` only when you need to reassign the variable\n- Avoid using `var` in modern JavaScript",

          "explanation": "Attempting to reassign a `const` variable will cause a TypeError. This is JavaScript's way of preventing you from changing values that should remain constant."
